/// A Unix stream socket
///
/// This type represents a `SOCK_STREAM` connection of the `AF_UNIX` family,
/// otherwise known as Unix domain sockets or Unix sockets. This stream is
/// readable/writable and acts similarly to a TCP stream where reads/writes are
/// all in order with respect to the other connected end.
///
/// A `UnixStream` implements the `Read`, `Write`, and `Evented` traits for
/// interoperating with other I/O code.
///
/// Note that the `read` and `write` methods may return an error with the kind
/// of `WouldBlock`, indicating that it's not ready to read/write just yet.
///
